# NavigateAU_Capstone_Project
Here is the full project as it was too large for Acorn Name: Ruth_Amoo Student_ID: 100160704 Course_Number: COMP_4983 Date_of_Upload: 6th_April,2024(06/04/2024) Email: 160704a@acadiau.ca Organization: Acadia_University A few things to note:
If you wish to test out the editor, please make sure that the Navigation Meash baking is on unless it gives an error that it can't find a path. I couldn't figure out why it was doing that without breaking my code.
When building and running, there is an already saved Nav.apk file. You are free to replace it and run as usual. Please make sure your device is plugged into whatever system you're using.
This app should be able to run on any ANDROID device.
If you have any questions or need me to provide anything else, please contact me. Thank you so much.
